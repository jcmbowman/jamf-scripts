	Purpose:
    When a designated user is created, run jamf recon, then trigger a
    specified Jamf policy .

    In our use case we will use a Jamf Pro policy to trigger the SetupYourMac
    workflow, but only if the designated LAPS account has been created on the
    local computer.

    This script is designed to flexible enough to use in other applications.

    Reason:
    Currently the Jamf Managed Local Administrator account is not being
    created during enrollment, but it will be created once a user logs in to
    the computer. This only works if no other processes are being run by the
    Jamf binary.

	The launch daemon and script are necessary because we want to fire off
    the SYM workflow as soon as the LAPS account has been created, but we
    don't want the Jamf binary to be occupied, thus blocking the creation
    of the Managed Local Administrator account.

	Instructions:

	1. Create a new script in Jamf Pro named something like
        "TriggerPolicyIfAccountExists.zsh".

	   Paste the entire contents of this script as-is into the Script field.

	   Under the Options tab, set the following parameter labels.
	   Parameter 4: Jamf Policy custom trigger (e.g., "symStart")
	   Parameter 5: Account to wait for (e.g., "jamfadmin")
	   Parameter 6: Organization Reverse Domain (e.g., "com.example")

	3. Create a smart computer group named something like:
	   "Recently Enrolled Computers"

	   Set its criteria to:
	   "Last Enrollment" - "less than x days ago" - "1".

	4. Add the script to a new policy named something like
       "Setup Your Mac - trigger if 'jamfadmin' exists".

	   Set the four script parameters:
       Jamf Policy custom trigger (e.g., "symStart")
       Jamf Managed LAPS account name (e.g., "jamfadmin")
	   Organization Reverse Domain (e.g., "com.example")

	   Enable the policy to trigger at Login with a frequency of
	   Once Per Computer.

	   Scope the policy:
	   Set Target to "Recently Enrolled Computers"

	After a computer is logged into and completes the policy, the
    LaunchDaemon will check every 15 seconds for up to 15 minutes to see if
    the designated account exists on the local computer.

    The script has also been configured such that you can simply hard-code
    your parameters and not bother setting them in the policy.

	(Note: This script has borrowed heavily from William Smith's
        'Re-enroll computers for LAPS.zsh' script, which can be found here:
